* Usecocoa Pods to get new Google Dependencies
** check for user signed in
*** if so don't display sign in button, instead show sign out button
*** if not display sign in button, not sign out
* On Signin button click
** check for signin error and handle gracefully, if the user clicks cancel they return a specific error
* -Fix view presentation errors-
* Create custom centeredTextStyleCell instead of duplicating in EditUserListTableViewController and ExerciseListTableViewController
* Add ability to save document to drive
* add ability to get list of folders from drive

* Add Start/End Workout button to bottom of ExerciceListTableViewController
* Add ability to move Excercieses from group to group
** Must not allow moving rows to the groups with the start button - done
** Attempt moving multiple rows before saving - seems ok so far
*** Bug - move from section 2 to top of section 1, then move from section 1 to section 2 - doesn't save
*** Bug - move row 2 or below in section 2, to row 1 in section 2, then move the same one to section 1 - saves wrong one
*** Bug - move all items out of row, then move item back into row - crash
** Do not need to save rows reordered within a group, should be checked in the service not on the controller
** tasks
*** Add Create Excercise method to ExerciseService that returns false if it fails
*** -In GroupService Call Create Excercise, then delete Exercise- done
*** -Modify DatabasePopulator to call ExerciseService create method-
*** -Pull Database editing methods out of the populator and into some sort of manager-
*** Figure out what should happen if you move all items out of a group
**** Either just leave it forever, or find a way to add a new group
***** then allow reodering of groups??
* Store the order of excercises within a group
* Add the ability to delete an Exercise by swiping
* Add the ability to add a new exercise
* Change the background of start button to green possibly
* Use the new version of GData
** https://code.google.com/p/google-api-objectivec-client/
* Make longer exercise names span 2 lines instead of ...
** lots to think about
*** What should happen during editing, since the width changes
*** it should change if the name is updated to be shorter or longer - done
** The order of methods is heightForRowAtIndexPath, for all rows, then CellForRowAtIndexPath
** need a method that can take a string, since that's all the Controller will have, and it will know if it is editing or not
*** the method must find out the width of the row based on the editing, and the string to figure out the height
** Posibly reload the view when going to edit mode?
* when moving to edit mode the cell transistion is a little off, willTransitionToState may be the solution
* Make the Excercise name input uppercase firt letter of all words
* replace lastRow and lastSection in ExerciseListTableViewController with NSIndexPath
