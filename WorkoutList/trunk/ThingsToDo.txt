* Add Start/End Workout button to bottom of ExerciceListTableViewController
* Add ability to move Excercieses from group to group
** Must not allow moving rows to the groups with the start button - done
** Attempt moving multiple rows before saving - seems ok so far
** Do not need to save rows reordered within a group, should be checked in the service not on the controller
** tasks
*** -Add Create Excercise method to ExerciseService- done
*** -In GroupService Call Create Excercise, then delete Exercise- done
*** Modify DatabasePopulator to call ExerciseService create method
*** Pull Database editing methods out of the populator and into some sort of manager

***** then allow reodering of groups??
